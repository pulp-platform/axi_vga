# AXI VGA

This repository contains a free and open-source, fully synthesizable VGA controller requesting pixel data directly using configurable AXI bursts. It is part of the PULP ecosystem.

## Caveats

While future improvements may relax these constraints, currently:

* We only support AXI data widths of 32b to 1024b.
* The pixel size in memory must be equal to the sum of the hardware channel widths.
* The pixel size in memory must be a divisor of the data bus width.

## Reconfiguring AXI VGA

To simplify VGA reconfiguration in your project, you can include the GNU Make fragment `axi_vga.mk` in your makefile, for example:

```make
include $(shell bender path axi_vga)/axi_vga.mk

# Inject alternative register layout if needed
$(AXI_VGA_ROOT)/data/axi_vga.hjson: config/axi_vga.json
    cp $< $@

# Rebuild VGA RTL
all: axi_vga
```

## Simulation

A simple standalone testbench is provided. If you have access to Questa Advanced Simulator, you can run it using the scripts provided in `vsim`:

```
make vsim
```
